# gtp
Go Text Protocol helper library for engines in Golang

<br>

Not really working on this any more, the library has too much board stuff in it, for which I now use my [sgf library](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/sgf).

An actual `twogtp` implementation is at [fohristiwhirl/twogtp](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/twogtp).
